# Shopify coding challenge
What I attempted to do here is to enable such functions in an image repository that given a certain image from the repository, a user may be able to retrieve similar images in the repository; a user may also search images by a short text description.

## Structure of the code
We use Flick 8k dataset as the source of our image repository, which would contain 8k images.

 - image_search.ipynb: A runnable notebook from Colab. Read more about the model and training dataset used. This is how we 
 - df.pkl: generated by the notebook, preprocessed texts and image array values saved in here to speed up the serving process.
 - Other files belong to the Flask application.

## Run the Flask app
(Due to time limitation, the web application is lacking in aesthetics and functionality.)

- To create Python virtual environment:
```
$python3 -m venv venv
$source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- To download the image dataset: 
```
$sh download.sh
```

- To run the local server:
```
$sh run.sh
```
